## Introduction

Delays is one of the important factors that needs to be considered by Airline authority as they cause great
inconvenience to the passengers forcing them to spend more spend more money and also to the airports thereby
affecting overall annual profits and reputation.The goal of this analysis is to identity the airports/airlines that
are more prone to delays and are experiencing higher delay times in the runways.It also tries to identify the
percentage of delays caused within a day and also over the year with the help of weather data.Identifying above
problems and providing solutions through in-depth analysis will help the airports to streamline operations
effectively and airline companies to hold their positions.

## Key Findings

Some of the key findings from my analysis reveal that United Airlines are more prone to arrival delays than
followed by American and Jetblue and it is due to fact that it has more domestic operations than any other
airlines.Flights that are delayed are experiencing additional taxi out,wheels on time of 5 to 10minutes when
compared to the flights that arrived early/on time.Airports located in West,Northeast,south region cities such
as Los Angeles,San Francisco,Denver,Boston,Network are experiencing delays in several hundreds annually
with an average delay time greater than 35 minutes.It should be noted that around 67% of these delays are
occurring during Evenings and Night times and they show up to increase between June-August.When it
comes to traffic on runways,the taxi-out time doesnâ€™t tend to show any impact on the flight arrival delay
but airlines such as Skywest,Alaska are facing increased taxi out times between January and April whereas
Frontier and ExpressJet are showing higher taxi out times during September along with median delay time
greater than 60minutes.Based on summary from the operations,it is observed that Alaska, Skywest,Express
Jet and Frontier are exhibiting more delay and arrival times while the taxi in and taxi out times among
airways are almost identical.Some of the features such as arrival delay,departure delay and wheels on time
are highly correlated with each other and delay in one of these variables affects other significantly.It should
be noted that delays and taxi out times are increasing as the temperature starts to drop between July and
November and decrease from January as it starts to raise.

## Recommendations

Based on my analysis,I would recommend FAA to initially reschedule some of the flights operating between
Evenings and Nights to Morning and Afternoon as these account for about majority of delays as well as
increase flights operations in Summer as this period is more susceptible to delays.It has been observed that
majority of delays are happening in cities located in West,South and Northeast regions with a median arrival
delay time greater than 37 minutes.While the tax-out and taxi-in times are considerably similar for all
the airlines,some of the less popular airlines are experiencing overall delays and taxi-out times especially
in Spring and Fall seasons.To overcome above mentioned issues,it is necessary to expand terminals and
runways for the corresponding airports/construct additional domestic airports if necessary.Since, arrival
delay,departure delay and wheels on time are dependent on one other,addressing one of the issues would
eliminate existing problems.It is also important to hire more airport staff to meet the increasing demand in
airport operations.Considering delays due to climatic conditions, airlines should take necessary actions such
as halting operations during extreme weather conditions,providing reschedules and refunds without any extra
charges.
