## Question 1: Are certain destinations or airlines prone to delays? 
**Answer**:United airlines are highly prone to delays with a delays more than 3000 followed by American and Jetblue with less than 500 delays with majority of them occurring in South and West regions .In addition to that, airports located in west region cities like Los Angeles,Francisco and Denver are experiencing around 700 delays followed by cities in northeast and South regions close to 400 delays.

  labs(title = "Destination cities and Arrival Delay Frequency",
             x = "Destination City",
             y = "Total no: of Delays")
  
```

## Question 2 : How the delay times are varying in different regions and which airports are experiencing more arrival delay times in each region? 
**Answer**: The median arrival delay time is highest in Northeast region(~48minutes) and lowest in Middle Atlantic region(~37minutes).The top 3 airports exhibiting higher delay times with respect to each region are
Daniel K Inouye,McCarran ,Seattle-Tacoma ,Orlando ,Tampa,Raleigh-Durham,Bradley ,Logan ,Newark Liberty ,Chicago OHare,Minneapolis-St Paul,Detroit Metro Wayne County,Dallas-Fort Worth ,Phoenix Sky Harbor,
George Bush Intercontinental,Norfolk.

summarise(arrival_delay_time=median(arrival_delay),total_arrival_delays=n()) %>%
filter(total_arrival_delays >10) %>% top_n(3, `arrival_delay_time`) %>% 
arrange(dest_airport_region,desc(arrival_delay_time))


```

## Question 3 : Are certain times of the day or year problematic?
**Answer**: Operations happening in the Evening(after 7pm) and Night(before 5am) seems to be problematic as they are accounting for 68.3% of total arrival delays as well as 67.11% of departure delays respectively.While the departure delays tend to be constant over the months,the arrival delay is high in the months from June-August and December.

```{r}

flights_df <- flights_df %>% 
  mutate(time_period = case_when(
    sch_arrival_time >= 5 & sch_arrival_time <12 ~ 'Morning',
    sch_arrival_time >= 12  & sch_arrival_time <17 ~ 'Afternoon',
    sch_arrival_time >= 17 & sch_arrival_time <21 ~ 'Evening',
    TRUE ~ 'Night'))

dt1<-flights_df %>% group_by(time_period) %>% filter(arrival_delay > 15) %>% 
  summarize(total_delays=n()) %>%  ungroup() %>% 
  mutate(percent_of_delays =  round(100*(total_delays/sum(total_delays)),2))

dt2<-flights_df %>% group_by(time_period) %>% filter(dep_delay > 15) %>% 
  summarize(total_delays=n()) %>%  ungroup() %>% 
  mutate(percent_of_delays = round(100*(total_delays/sum(total_delays)),2))

fig1<- ggplot(dt1, aes(x = "", y = percent_of_delays, fill = time_period)) +
  geom_col(color = "black") +guides(fill=guide_legend(title="Duration"))+
  geom_text(aes(label = percent_of_delays),
            position = position_stack(vjust = 0.5)) +
  coord_polar(theta = "y")+theme_void() +  scale_fill_brewer() +
  labs(title = "Dist. of Total Arrival Delays within a Day(%)")

fig2<- ggplot(dt2, aes(x = 2, y = percent_of_delays, fill = time_period)) +
  geom_col(color = "black") +guides(fill=guide_legend(title="Duration"))+
  geom_text(aes(label = percent_of_delays),
            position = position_stack(vjust = 0.5)) +
  coord_polar(theta = "y")+theme_void() +  scale_fill_brewer() +
  labs(title = "Dist. of Total Depature Delays within a Day(%)")

grid.arrange(fig1, fig2, nrow = 2)


monthly_dep_delay_percentage<-flights_df %>% group_by(month) %>% 
summarize(total_dep_delays=n()) %>%  ungroup() %>% 
mutate(percent_of_delays = round(100*(total_dep_delays/sum(total_dep_delays)),2)) %>% arrange(desc(percent_of_delays))

monthly_dep_delay_percentage

monthly_arr_delay_percentage<-flights_df %>% group_by(month) %>%

mutate(percent_of_delays = round(100*(total_arr_delays/sum(total_arr_delays)),2)) %>% arrange(desc(percent_of_delays))

monthly_arr_delay_percentage

```

## Question 4:Are flight delays affected by taxi-out and taxi-in time?
**Answer**: Based on the results from the scatter plot it is evident that flight delays are not affected by taxi in/out times.
```{r}

dt2<-flights_df%>% select(taxi_out,arrival_delay) %>% filter(arrival_delay>15) 
fig1<-ggplot(dt2,aes(x=taxi_out,y=arrival_delay)) + 
  geom_point(size=2, shape=21,color="steelblue",alpha = 0.2) + 
  labs(title = "Relation b/w Taxi out time & arrival delay ",
             y = "Arrival Delay",
             x = "Taxi out time") +
  geom_smooth(method=lm, se=FALSE, fullrange=TRUE,color="red")

dt1<-flights_df%>% select(taxi_in,arrival_delay) %>% filter(arrival_delay>15) 
fig2<-ggplot(dt1,aes(x=taxi_in,y=arrival_delay)) + 
  geom_point(size=2, shape=21,color="steelblue",alpha = 0.2) + 
  labs(title = "Relation b/w Taxi in time & arrival delay ",
             y = "Arrival Delay",
             x = "Taxi in time") +
  geom_smooth(method=lm, se=FALSE, fullrange=TRUE,color="red")


grid.arrange(fig1, fig2, nrow = 2)
```

## Question 5: Do certain airlines or time of year lead to greater taxi out times (i.e. traffic jams on the runways)?
*Answer*: Alaska airlines is showing higher taxi out between January and July whereas Skywest is experiencing increased taxi out time from January before reaching a peak time of 30mins in May.While,Frontier is showing greater taxi out times from September; Express Jet is showing higher taxi out times in the month of May with a peak time of 25mins before increasing again in September.
```{r}
flights_df %>% group_by(airline,month) %>% 
  summarize(avg_taxi_out=median(taxi_out)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=month,y=avg_taxi_out,color =airline,group=airline)) + 
  geom_line() +geom_point()+
  labs(title = "Line Graph representation of Average Taxi Out Time",
      y = "Average Taxi Out Time",
      x = "Month") +theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = -0.1))

```

## Question 6: How various airlines are performing on the runway and with respect to delay times?
**Answer**: During taxi-in American and Frontier are experiencing higher delay times.In terms of delay in arrivals and departures Alaska, Skywest,Express Jet and Frontier are highest when compared to other airlines.
```{r}
flights_df %>% group_by(airline) %>% filter(dep_delay >0 & arrival_delay>15) %>%  
  summarize(arr_delay=median(arrival_delay),
                        dep_delay=median(dep_delay),
                        taxi_in=median(taxi_in),
                      wheels_on=median(wheels_on),
                        taxi_out=median(taxi_out)) %>% 
                        arrange(desc(taxi_out)) %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = c(arr_delay, dep_delay,taxi_in,taxi_out,wheels_on), 
             names_to = 'value_type', 
             values_to = 'total_count') %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=reorder(airline,total_count),y=total_count,fill =airline)) + 
  geom_bar(stat="identity",position = "dodge") + facet_wrap(~value_type) + 
  coord_flip() +
  labs(title = "Bar Graph representation of Performance of US Airlines",
             x = "Airlines",
             y = "Time(minutes)")
```

## Question 7: Does delay in departures cause arrival delay in destination?
**Answer**: Yes,from the scatter plot it can be observed that the arrival delay is increasing linearly with respect to the increase in departure delay.
```{r}
ggplot(flights_df,aes(x=dep_delay,y=arrival_delay)) + 
  geom_point(size=2, shape=21,color="steelblue",alpha = 0.4) + 
  labs(title = "Relation b/w Departure Delay & Arrival Delay ",
             x = "Departure Delay",
             y = "Arrival Delay") +
  geom_smooth(method=lm, se=FALSE, fullrange=TRUE,color="red")
```

## Question 8:How are the airline characterstics related to each other**
**Answer**:The heat map explains that the wheels on time is highly correlated with the arrival time and moderately correlated with the departure time.It also explains that departure delay is positively correlated with arrival delay.It is interesting to note that delays are not affected by distance variable.
```{r,fig.width=7, fig.height=6}
numeric_df<-Filter(is.numeric, flights_df)
ggcorrplot(cor(numeric_df), hc.order = TRUE, type = "lower",
            lab = TRUE,digits = 2)+ 
  labs(title = "Correlation Matrix of Airline Characterstics")
    
```
## Question 9 :What are the taxi in/taxi-out times for the flights that arrived early over the flights that are delayed?
**Answer**:Airlines that are delayed are experiencing additional taxi out,wheels on time of 5 to 10minutes when compared to the flights that arrived early.For taxi in time there has been any major difference expect for Jet and Frontier airlines which have taxi in time greater than 10minutes.
```{r}

flights_df %>% 
  mutate(arrival_state = case_when(
    arrival_delay <=15 ~ 'Early/Ontime',
    TRUE ~ 'Delayed')) %>% group_by(airline,arrival_state) %>% 
  summarise(taxi_out_time=median(taxi_out),taxi_in_time=median(taxi_in),wheels_on=median(wheels_on)) %>% 
  arrange(arrival_state)  

```
## Bonus Question:Does weather have any impact on delay of airlines**
**Answer**:Yes ,weather has a great impact on the airline delays and it is evident from the increasing delay,arrival and taxi out between July and November when temperatures are falling down.On the other hand from January,when the temperature are slowly rising, the delay rates are decreasing gradually.
```{r}
temp_df<-read.csv("temperature.csv")
#Parsing Dates
flights_df$scheduled_flight_date<- ymd(flights_df$scheduled_flight_date)
temp_df$Date<- ymd(temp_df$Date)
temp_df$Average<-(temp_df$Average-32)*5/9
#Joining Temperature dataset by Date column
final_df<-left_join(flights_df, temp_df,
                    by = c("scheduled_flight_date" = "Date"))
#Checking for NA rows after joining                  
sum(is.na(final_df))

weather_df<-final_df %>% group_by(month) %>% filter(dep_delay >0,arrival_delay>0) %>%  
  summarize(`avg_temp(c*)`=round(mean(Average),2),
            total_flights=n(),
            dep_delay_rate=round((median(arrival_delay)/total_flights)*100,2),
            arr_delay_rate=round((median(dep_delay)/total_flights)*100,2),
            taxi_in_rate=round(median(taxi_in)*100/n(),2),
            taxi_out_rate=round(median(taxi_out)*100/n(),2)) %>% 
pivot_longer(cols = c(`avg_temp(c*)`,dep_delay_rate,arr_delay_rate,taxi_in_rate,taxi_out_rate), 
               names_to = 'value_type', 
               values_to = 'values')

weather_df

ggplot(weather_df,aes(x=month,y=values,color =value_type,group=value_type)) + 
  geom_line() +geom_point()+
  labs(title = "Effect of Temperature on Delay times",
       y = "Value",
       x = "Month") +theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = -0.1))

```
# Executive Summary

## 1.Introduction
Delays is one of the important factors that needs to be considered by Airline authority as they cause great inconvenience to the passengers forcing them to spend more spend more money and also to the airports thereby affecting overall annual profits and reputation.The goal of this analysis is to identity the airports/airlines that are more prone to delays and are experiencing higher delay times in the runways.It also tries to identify the  percentage of delays caused within a day and also over the year with the help of weather data.Identifying above problems and providing solutions through in-depth analysis will help the airports to streamline operations effectively and airline companies to hold their positions.

## 2.Key Findings

Some of the key findings from my analysis reveal that United Airlines are more prone to arrival delays than followed by American and Jetblue and it is due to fact that it has more domestic operations than any other airlines.Flights that are delayed are experiencing additional taxi out,wheels on time of 5 to 10minutes when compared to the flights that arrived early/on time.Airports located in West,Northeast,south region cities such as Los Angeles,San Francisco,Denver,Boston,Network are experiencing delays in several hundreds annually with an average delay time greater than 35 minutes.It should be noted that around 67% of these delays are occurring during Evenings and Night times and they show up to increase between June-August.

When it comes to traffic on runways,the taxi-out time doesn't tend to show any impact on the flight arrival delay but airlines such as Skywest,Alaska  are facing increased taxi out times between January and April whereas Frontier and ExpressJet are showing higher taxi out times during September along with median delay time greater than 60minutes.Based on summary from the operations,it is observed that Alaska, Skywest,Express Jet and Frontier are exhibiting more delay and arrival times while the taxi in and taxi out times among airways are almost identical.Some of the features such as arrival delay,departure delay and wheels on time are highly correlated with each other and delay in one of these variables affects other significantly.It should be noted that delays and taxi out times are increasing as the temperature starts to drop between July and November and decrease from January as it starts to raise.

        
## 3.Recommendations

Based on my analysis,I would recommend FAA to initially reschedule some of the flights operating between Evenings and Nights to Morning and Afternoon as these account for about majority of delays as well as increase flights operations in Summer as this period is  more susceptible to delays.It has been observed that  majority of delays are happening in cities located in West,South and Northeast regions with a median arrival delay time greater than 37 minutes.While the tax-out and taxi-in times are considerably similar for all the airlines,some of the less popular airlines are experiencing overall delays and taxi-out times especially in Spring and Fall seasons.

To overcome above mentioned issues,it is necessary to expand terminals and runways for the corresponding airports/construct additional domestic airports if necessary.Since, arrival delay,departure delay and wheels on time are dependent on one other,addressing one of the issues would eliminate existing problems.It is also important to hire more airport staff to meet the increasing demand in airport operations.Considering delays due to climatic conditions, airlines should take necessary actions such as halting operations during extreme weather conditions,providing reschedules and refunds without any extra charges.
